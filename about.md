Welcome to the webpage of Women in CS @ TUM, formerly known as  Informatik-Forum Frauen (IFF)!

We are a group of members of [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.in.tum.de/) at Department of Informatics working towards equal participation of women and other under-represented groups.

We organize monthly events throughout the semester on a variety of topics such as how to pursue a CS career in industry, PhD advices and study tips. You can take a look into some of our [past events](/archive) for further information. Our events are open to everyone interested. You can follow our Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook page to stay tuned for the upcoming events.

The best way to engage with us is through our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/G7Ru7YdBsc). Feel free to join, introduce yourself and get in touch with our members!
