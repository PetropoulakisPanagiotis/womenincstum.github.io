This year's Raitenhaslach trip was a blast! 

We gathered with our new and old members at Raitenhaslach ...

// From instagram

The trip was a significant experience for us as a group since it helped to integrate the new members into the team and enhance the feeling of belonging to the community. 

Being surrounded by many inspiring women motivated us to talk, explore and work together to develop the Women in CS@TUM team. All of the members actively participated in the conversations, willing to contribute to improving the Women in CS@TUM club. 

We start the new semester with a strong belief that we can achieve many things together! 

Would you like to get to know us better? After each event we offer networking, so stay tuned and take part in our events
